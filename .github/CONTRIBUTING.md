## Pull Requests

Pull requests are continuously being reviewed and merged. In order to ease this process, please open a pull request as draft, as long as it is under development, to notify anyone else that a given feature/issue is being worked on.

Additionally, please add `Closes #{ISSUE_ID}` if the pull request is linked to a specific issue. If a PR addresses multiple pull requests, please add `Closes #{ISSUE_ID}` for each one.

A CI workflow is executed against all pull requests and must succeed before the pull request can be merged, so please make sure that you check the workflow status and potential error messages.
